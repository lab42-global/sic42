# Welcome to the sic42 Repository

## Introduction

This repository is the main hub for the [sic42 package](https://github.com/lab42-global/sic42), a new simulation environment for researching and developing swarm intelligence currently in beta. It serves as the foundational codebase for participants in the [Swarm Intelligence Cup (SIC)](https://lab42.global/sic/), where the collective behavior of simple agents can emerge as complex, intelligent systems.

## Getting Started

Dive into the sic42 environment by following the steps outlined in our [Quick Start](https://sic.lab42.global/quick-start/) guide.

## Repository Features

- **Template Scripts:** Jumpstart your swarm creation with our templates. [Get started quickly](https://github.com/lab42-global/sic42-template).
- **Detailed Documentation:** Access comprehensive guides and explanations at the [documentation repository](https://github.com/lab42-global/sic42-doc), or use the
  technical documentation pdf included in this repository for all the details.
- **Community Contributions:** Collaborate and share insights with other participants and tell us how we can improve the package.

## About the Swarm Intelligence Cup

At Lab42, we believe in the power of swarm intelligence as a pathway to achieving human-level AI. The SIC is our arena for like-minded individuals to test theories, collaborate, and push the boundaries of artificial intelligence through the lens of swarm behaviors. This initiative is a call to explore a world where agents, while individually executing simple tasks, collectively drive forward complex and intelligent behaviors.

## Contributing to sic42

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a branch for your contribution before submitting a pull request. You are also invited to [join the Lab42 Discord server](https://discord.gg/waRCYPEc6C) to discuss AI in general but also SIC.

## Feedback

If you have suggestions for improving sic42 or if you encounter any issues, please submit an issue on our GitHub page. Your feedback is valuable in helping us make continuous improvements.

## Building sic42 Locally
